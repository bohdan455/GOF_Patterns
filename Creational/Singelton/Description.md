A Singleton ensures that only one instance of a class exists during the application’s lifetime and provides a global access point to it.
Depending on the implementation, the instance can be created at startup (eager initialization) or when it is first needed (lazy initialization).

No example is need because we can create singelton by using AddSingelton<T>() in asp.net core
