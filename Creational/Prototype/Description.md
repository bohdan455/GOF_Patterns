The Prototype pattern is useful when creating new objects is expensive or complex, and we want to create a duplicate (clone) of an existing object instead.
It allows us to make copies of objects at runtime without knowing their exact class, using a cloning interface (like ICloneable in C#).
This is especially useful when object creation involves heavy configuration or external resources.
